# Add offline data sync to your Windows (UWP) app

This tutorial covers the offline sync feature of Azure Mobile Apps for the UWP quickstart app. Offline sync allows end users to interact with a mobile app&mdash;viewing, adding, or modifying data&mdash;even when there's no network connection. Changes are stored in a local database. Once the device is back online, these changes are synced with the remote backend.

Before starting this tutorial, you should have completed the [UWP Quickstart Tutorial](./index.md), which includes creating a suitable backend service.  We also assume you have [added authentication](./authentication.md) to your application.  You can add offline capabilities to your app without authentication.

## Update the app to support offline sync

In online operation, you read to and write from a `IRemoteTable<T>`.  When using offline sync, you read to and write from a `IOfflineTable<T>` instead.  The `IOfflineTable<T>` is backed by an on-device SQLite database, and synchronized with the backend database.

### Add the necessary NuGet packages

[!INCLUDE[Instructions for altering the code to support offline.](~/mobile-apps/azure-mobile-apps/includes/quickstart/windows/add-offline-code.md)]

### Set the offline database location

In the `TodoApp.UWP` project, edit the `App.xaml.cs` file.  Change the definition of the `RemoteTodoService` as follows:

``` csharp
TodoService = new RemoteTodoService(GetAuthenticationToken)
{
    OfflineDb = ApplicationData.Current.LocalCacheFolder.Path + "\\offline.db"
};
```

If you have not completed the [authentication tutorial](./authentication.md), the definition should look like this instead:

``` csharp
TodoService = new RemoteTodoService()
{
    OfflineDb = ApplicationData.Current.LocalCacheFolder.Path + "\\offline.db"
};
```

You may need to add the following to the top of the file if `ApplicationData` is not recognized:

``` csharp
using Windows.Storage;
```

> [!NOTE]
> The Universal Windows Platform restricts where you can read and write data.  You can use any of the storage folders in [`ApplicationData.Current`](/uwp/api/Windows.Storage.ApplicationData?view=winrt-22000&preserve-view=true).  If you want to ensure that the data is available but not backed up to the cloud, use `LocalCacheFolder`.
