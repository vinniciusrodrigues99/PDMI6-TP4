# Build an Avalonia app with Azure Mobile Apps

[Avalonia](https://www.avaloniaui.net/) lets you create .NET GUI applications for Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android, and Web Assembly from a single codebase.  This tutorial shows you how to add a cloud-based backend service to a Windows Avalonia desktop app by using Azure Mobile Apps and an Azure mobile app backend. You'll create both a new mobile app backend and a simple *Todo list* app that stores app data in Azure.

You must complete this tutorial before all other Avalonia tutorials about using Azure Mobile Apps.

## Prerequisites

To complete this tutorial, you need:

* [Visual Studio 2022](/visualstudio/install/install-visual-studio?view=vs-2022&preserve-view=true) with the following workloads.
  * ASP.NET and web development
  * Azure development
  * .NET desktop development
* The [Avalonia for Visual Studio extension](https://docs.avaloniaui.net/docs/getting-started/ide-support#visual-studio).
* An [Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial).
* The [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).
  * Sign in with `az login` and select an appropriate subscription before starting.
* (Optional) The [Azure Developer CLI](/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/install-azd).

Although Avalonia supports building on Mac or Windows, this tutorial assumes you are using Windows and Visual Studio 2022.  We recommend that you walk through the [Avalonia tutorial](https://docs.avaloniaui.net/docs/next/get-started/test-drive/introduction) to become acquainted with the development process for Avalonia.

## Download the sample app

[!INCLUDE [Instructions to download the sample from GitHub.](~/mobile-apps/azure-mobile-apps/includes/quickstart/windows/download-sample.md)]

## Deploy the backend to Azure

> [!NOTE]
> If you have already deployed the backend from another quick start, you can use the same backend and skip this step.

[!INCLUDE [Instructions for deploying a backend service.](~/mobile-apps/azure-mobile-apps/includes/quickstart/windows/deploy-backend.md)]

## Configure the sample app

[!INCLUDE [Instructions for configuring the sample code.](~/mobile-apps/azure-mobile-apps/includes/quickstart/windows/configure-sample.md)]

## Build and run the sample app

1. In the solutions explorer, expand the `others` folder.
1. Right-click the `TodoApp.AvaloniaUI` project and select **Set as Startup Project**.
1. In the top bar, select the **Any CPU** configuration and the **TodoApp.AvaloniaUI** target:

2. Press **F5** to build and run the project.

Once the app has started, you'll see an empty list with a text box.  You can:

* Enter some text, then press the **+** icon to add the item.
* Set or clear the check box to mark any item as done.
* Press the refresh icon to reload data from the service.
