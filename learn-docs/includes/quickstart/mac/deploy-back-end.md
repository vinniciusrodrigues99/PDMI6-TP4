To deploy the backend service, we will:

* Provision an Azure App Service and Azure SQL Database to Azure.
* Use Visual Studio 2022 for Mac to deploy the service code to the newly created Azure App Service.

### Use the Azure Developer CLI to complete all steps

The TodoApp sample is configured to support the Azure Developer CLI.  To complete all steps (provisioning and deploying):

1. [Install the Azure Developer CLI](/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/install-azd).
2. Open a terminal and change directory to the folder containing the `TodoApp.sln` file.  This directory also contains `azure.yaml`.
3. Run `azd up`.

If you aren't already signed-in to Azure, the browser launches to ask you to sign-in.  You're then be prompted for a subscription
and Azure region to use.  The Azure Developer CLI then provisions the necessary resources and deploys the service code to the Azure
region and subscription of your choice. Finally, the Azure Developer CLI writes an appropriate `Constants.cs` file for you.

You can run the `azd env get-values` command to see the SQL authentication information should you wish to access the database directly.

If you have completed the steps with the Azure Developer CLI, [proceed to the next step](#azd-skip-step-mac).  If you don't wish to use the Azure Developer
CLI, proceed with the manual steps.

### Create resources on Azure

1. Open a terminal and change directory to the folder containing the `TodoApp.sln` file. This directory also contains `azuredeploy.json`.
2. Ensure you've [signed in and selected a subscription](/cli/azure/authenticate-azure-cli) using the Azure CLI.
3. Create a new resource group:

    ``` azurecli
    az group create -l westus -g quickstart
    ```

    This command creates the `quickstart` resource group in the West US region.  You can select any region that you wish, providing you can create resources there.  Ensure you use the same name and region wherever they're mentioned in this tutorial.

4. Create the resources using a group deployment:

    ``` azurecli
    az deployment group create -g quickstart --template-file azuredeploy.json --parameters sqlPassword=MyPassword1234
    ```

    Pick a strong password for your SQL Administrator password.  You need it later on when accessing the database.

5. Once the deployment is complete, get the output variables as these hold important information you need later on:

    ``` azurecli
    az deployment group show -g quickstart -n azuredeploy --query properties.outputs
    ```

    An example output is:

    ![Screenshot of command line results.](~/mobile-apps/azure-mobile-apps/media/quickstart/mac/deploy-back-end-outputs.png)

6. Make a note of each of the values in the outputs for later use.

### Publish the service code

Open the `TodoApp.sln` in Visual Studio 2022 for Mac.

1. Right-click the `TodoApp` solution, then select **Restore NuGet Packages**.
2. Wait for the NuGet package restoration to complete.
3. Right-click the `TodoAppService.NET6` project, then **Publish** > **Publish to Azure...**.
4. Select the service you created earlier (in the `quickstart` resource group), then select **Publish**.

5. Once the backend service is published, a browser is opened. Add `/tables/todoitem?ZUMO-API-VERSION=3.0.0` to the URL:
