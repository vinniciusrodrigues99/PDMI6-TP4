To deploy the backend service, we will:

* Provision an Azure App Service and Azure SQL Database to Azure.
* Use Visual Studio to deploy the service code to the newly created Azure App Service.

### Use the Azure Developer CLI to complete all steps

The TodoApp sample is configured to support the Azure Developer CLI.  To complete all steps (provisioning and deploying):

1. [Install the Azure Developer CLI](/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/install-azd).
2. Open a terminal and change directory to the folder containing the `TodoApp.sln` file.  This directory also contains `azure.yaml`.
3. Run `azd up`.

If you aren't already signed-in to Azure, the browser launches to ask you to sign-in.  You're then be prompted for a subscription
and Azure region to use.  The Azure Developer CLI then provisions the necessary resources and deploys the service code to the Azure
region and subscription of your choice. Finally, the Azure Developer CLI writes an appropriate `Constants.cs` file for you.

You can run the `azd env get-values` command to see the SQL authentication information should you wish to access the database directly.

If you have completed the steps with the Azure Developer CLI, [proceed to the next step](#azd-skip-step-win).  If you don't wish to use the Azure Developer
CLI, proceed with the manual steps.

### Create resources on Azure.

1. Open a terminal and change directory to the folder containing the `TodoApp.sln` file. This directory also contains `azuredeploy.json`.
2. Ensure you've [signed in and selected a subscription](/cli/azure/authenticate-azure-cli) using the Azure CLI.
3. Create a new resource group:

    ``` azurecli
    az group create -l westus -g quickstart
    ```

    This command creates the `quickstart` resource group in the West US region.  You can select any region that you wish, providing you can create resources there.  Ensure you use the same name and region wherever they're mentioned in this tutorial.

4. Create the resources using a group deployment:

    ``` azurecli
    az deployment group create -g quickstart --template-file azuredeploy.json --parameters sqlPassword=MyPassword1234
    ```

    Pick a strong password for your SQL Administrator password.  You need it later on when accessing the database.

5. Once the deployment is complete, get the output variables as these hold important information you need later on:

    ``` azurecli
    az deployment group show -g quickstart -n azuredeploy --query properties.outputs
    ```

    An example output is:

6. Make a note of each of the values in the outputs for later use.

### Publish the service code

Open the `TodoApp.sln` in Visual Studio.

1. In the right-hand pane, select the **Solutions Explorer**.
2. Right-click the `TodoAppService.NET6` project, then select **Set as Startup Project**.
3. On the top menu, select **Build** > **Publish TodoAppService.NET6**.
4. In the **Publish** window, select Target: **Azure**, then press **Next**.

5. Select Specific target: **Azure App Service (Windows)**, then press **Next**.

6. If necessary, sign in and select an appropriate **Subscription name**.
7. Ensure **View** is set to **Resource group**.
8. Expand the `quickstart` resource group, then select the App Service that was created earlier.

9. Select **Finish**.
10. Once the publish profile creation process has completed, select **Close**.
11. Locate the **Service Dependencies** and select the triple-dots next to the SQL Server Database, then select **Connect**.

12. Select **Azure SQL Database**, then select **Next**.
13. Select the **quickstart** database, then select **Next**.

    ![Screenshot of the database selection window.](~/mobile-apps/azure-mobile-apps/media/quickstart/windows/publish-backend-select-db.png)

14. Fill in the form using the SQL username and password that were in the outputs of the deployment, then select **Next**.

    ![Screenshot of the database settings window.](~/mobile-apps/azure-mobile-apps/media/quickstart/windows/publish-backend-configure-db.png)

15. Select **Finish**.
16. Select **Close** when complete.
17. Select **Publish** to publish your app to the Azure App Service you created earlier.

18. Once the backend service is published, a browser is opened. Add `/tables/todoitem?ZUMO-API-VERSION=3.0.0` to the URL:
