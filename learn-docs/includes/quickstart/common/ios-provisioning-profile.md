> [!NOTE]
> Since the iOS app requires keychain access, you will need to set up a provisioning profile.  A provisioning profile requires either a real device or a paid Apple Developer Account (if using the simulator). For more information, see [Device provisioning for iOS](/xamarin/ios/get-started/installation/device-provisioning).
